# Data Workshops at KTH

This is the official repository for the data workshops created by [Harald Lindblom](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harald-lindblom-0b1836135/) and [Frederik Spang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frederik-spang-21234b209/) at KTH. Many thanks to [KTH AI Society](https://kthais.com/) for giving us the opportunity to realize these workshops.

The idea is to provide a way for students to practice applied data work, focusing on data science, ML engineering and quantitative analysis. Each session comes with a prepared dataset and a few suggested directions to explore. Participants work independently or together at their own pace, while we stay available throughout the session to help with questions, ideas, or debugging.

## How it works

We meet every Wednesday at KTH Innovation at the KTH campus in Stockholm. Each workshop is built around a provided dataset. We begin with a brief introduction to the data and some potential exploration paths, then give participants time to work independently or together, with support available throughout.


## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to support a weekly workshop format. Each workshop has its own directory inside the data/ folder, and contains at minimum a starter Jupyter notebook:

```

```
