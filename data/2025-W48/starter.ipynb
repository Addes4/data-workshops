    "# IMDB Movie dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, you'll work with a curated subset of movies from the IMDB database.  \n",
    "Each row is a movie, with information such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `primaryTitle` – the main title\n",
    "- `startYear` – release year\n",
    "- `runtimeMinutes` – duration\n",
    "- `genres` – comma-separated genres\n",
    "- `averageRating` – average user rating\n",
    "- `numVotes` – number of votes\n",
    "- `directors`, `writers` – main credited creators\n",
    "\n",
    "As promised, we also provide some possible things to do to get started. Pick a level, dig in, or ignore them and do your own thing. Happy coding!\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Level 1\n",
    "- New to Pandas? Start by taking a look at the [official documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/). A good first step is often to look at basic summaries (`.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`).\n",
    "- Think of your favorite movie. Got it? Find it in the data!\n",
    "- What does the distribution of ratings look like? Plot a [histogram](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.hist.html) over `averageRating` to find out!\n",
    "- Look around for outliers (unusually long, unusually high-rated, or unexpectedly low-rated movies). It's especially amusing reading about the low-rated ones on [IMDB's website](https://www.imdb.com/).\n",
    "- Find a movie you like and identify the director. Can you calculate his average rating? How does it compare to the the average rating for movies in general?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Level 2\n",
    "- Compare ratings or runtimes across decades (e.g. before 1950 vs after 2000). Can you put your finding into a nice visualization?\n",
    "- Create a new metric (e.g. “rating adjusted for popularity”) and rank movies by it.\n",
    "- Clean and split the `genres` column so each genre can be counted separately.\n",
    "- How does the number of reviews explain ratings? Investigate the relationship between `averageRating` and `numVotes`. \n",
    "- Build a simple model to predict `averageRating` from features like year, runtime and genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Level 3\n",
    "- It would not be a proper data workshop if we didn't mentioned XGBoost at least once. Try to predict `averageRating` using `startYear`, `runtimeMinutes`, `directors`, `writers`, and `genres`. Encoding is necessary, and target encoding with additive smoothing might be a smart move (see [this blog post](https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/target-encoding/)).\n",
    "- Let's stop messing around and get into Bayesian modeling. Pick your favorite writer and quantify how likely they are to make a good movie, where, for the sake of convenience, we define a good movie as one having a rating higher than 7. *Hint:* You might consider using a [Beta–Binomial conjugate model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior#When_the_likelihood_function_is_a_discrete_distribution)."
