    "# Telco Customer Churn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, you'll work with a classic telecom dataset from [IBM Sample Data Sets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn), where the goal is to understand and predict **customer churn** — whether a customer left the company within the last month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row corresponds to a customer, with the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `customerID` – unique customer identifier\n",
    "- `gender` – Male or Female\n",
    "- `SeniorCitizen` – whether the customer is a senior citizen (1 = yes, 0 = no)\n",
    "- `Partner` – whether the customer has a partner (Yes/No)\n",
    "- `Dependents` – whether the customer has dependents (Yes/No)\n",
    "- `tenure` – number of months the customer has been with the company\n",
    "- `PhoneService` – whether the customer has phone service (Yes/No)\n",
    "- `MultipleLines` – whether the customer has multiple lines (Yes/No/No phone service)\n",
    "- `InternetService` – type of internet service (DSL, Fiber optic, No)\n",
    "- `OnlineSecurity` – whether the customer has online security (Yes/No/No internet service)\n",
    "- `OnlineBackup` – whether the customer has online backup (Yes/No/No internet service)\n",
    "- `DeviceProtection` – whether the customer has device protection (Yes/No/No internet service)\n",
    "- `TechSupport` – whether the customer has tech support (Yes/No/No internet service)\n",
    "- `StreamingTV` – whether the customer streams TV (Yes/No/No internet service)\n",
    "- `StreamingMovies` – whether the customer streams movies (Yes/No/No internet service)\n",
    "- `Contract` – contract term (Month-to-month, One year, Two year)\n",
    "- `PaperlessBilling` – whether the customer uses paperless billing (Yes/No)\n",
    "- `PaymentMethod` – payment method (Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer, Credit card)\n",
    "- `MonthlyCharges` – the monthly charge amount\n",
    "- `TotalCharges` – the total amount charged over the customer's tenure\n",
    "- `Churn` – whether the customer churned (Yes/No) — **this is the target variable**\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you'll find some possible starting points. Pick the level that best suits you, dig in, or ignore them and do your own thing. Happy coding!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Beginner**\n",
    "- Start by getting oriented with `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`.\n",
    "    - How many rows/columns do you have?\n",
    "    - Which columns are numeric vs categorical?\n",
    "    - Are there missing values?\n",
    "- What is the overall churn rate? Use `df[\"Churn\"].value_counts()` to find out.\n",
    "- Explore the categorical columns using `.value_counts()`:\n",
    "    - `Contract`, `InternetService`, `PaymentMethod`\n",
    "    - Do any categories stand out as particularly common or rare?\n",
    "- Make a histogram of `tenure` and another of `MonthlyCharges`. What do the distributions look like?\n",
    "- Compute the churn rate by `Contract` type using [groupby](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html). Which contract type has the highest churn?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Intermediate**\n",
    "- Build a summary table: for each `InternetService` type, compute the churn rate, mean `MonthlyCharges`, and mean `tenure`.\n",
    "- Investigate the relationship between `tenure` and churn. Bin `tenure` into groups (e.g. 0–12, 13–24, 25–48, 49–72 months) using [`pd.cut()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.cut.html) and compute the churn rate per group.\n",
    "- Make a figure with a few subplots comparing churn rates across different features (e.g. `Contract`, `InternetService`, `TechSupport`, `PaymentMethod`).\n",
    "- Fit a [logistic regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) predicting `Churn` from `tenure`, `MonthlyCharges`, and `Contract`. Which features matter most?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Advanced**\n",
    "- Encode all categorical features and build a full predictive model:\n",
    "    - Split into train/test sets.\n",
    "    - Try a tree-based model such as [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python-Intro.html), or [CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/docs/en/concepts/python-quickstart).\n",
    "    - Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC. Since the classes are imbalanced, why might accuracy alone be misleading?\n",
    "- Interpretability: use [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to identify which features drive churn predictions the most. Do the results match your intuition from the EDA?\n",
    "- Think about the business side: if it costs the company $X$ to retain a customer, and a churned customer represents $Y$ in lost revenue, how would you turn your model into a decision rule for who to target with a retention offer?"
